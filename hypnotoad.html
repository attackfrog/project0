    <p>The Hypnotoad is a large toad-like alien featured in the TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama" title="Futurama on Wikipedia">Futurama</a> with pulsating, multicolored eyes, which emits a loud, ominous buzzing noise. It has the power to hypnotize almost any living thing at will, even mass numbers of creatures. The Hypnotoad first appeared in "The Day the Earth Stood Stupid", in which it hypnotized a flock of sheep to herd themselves into a pen and close the door behind them, the panel of judges to win the pet show and then the audience of the pet show to force their approval of that victory. It later acquired its own television show, <em>Everybody Loves Hypnotoad</em>, in which it hypnotizes the audience (except for Fry, due to his lack of a Delta brain wave and the fact that he feels the show has been going downhill since its third season). The <em>Futurama: Bender's Big Score</em> DVD includes a full 22-minute episode. The episode mainly features the Hypnotoad staring into the camera, occasionally intercut with a laugh track or shots of the exteriors of various locations to indicate a scene change. The finale of the show consists of a voiceover telling the audience that they will wake up remembering nothing and feeling refreshed, and the credits are all attributed to Hypnotoad.</p>
