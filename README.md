# Project 0: Notable Frogs

*Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Summer 2018*

This is a simple informational website containing information about some notable and famous frogs in various forms of media. Three of them have a page dedicated specifically to them containing a picture and some information from their Wikipedia pages. The rest just have links to Wikipedia pages about them or the works they appear in. 

`index.html` is the "home page" of this site, as you'd expect. From there, you can navigate to `kermit.html`, `mrtoad.html`, and `hypnotoad.html`, each of which are the bio pages for their subjects.
